== Setup Workspace ==
Create an eclipse workspace in ./eclipse-workspace. Afterwards close the workspace again and run the following commands.

[pieber@coprime trunk]$ eclipse:configure-workspace 
[pieber@coprime trunk]$ mvn clean install eclipse:clean eclipse:eclipse 

Afterwards start eclipse again and import existing eclipse projects.

== Create Project ==
TBW

== Full Run ==
Before a push, run the following command:

mvn clean install -Pall-test,license-check

== Build Docs ==
To build the documentation use the following command:

mvn clean install -Pdocs

== Scripts ==
Scripts which help you to create projects, run the workspace and so on are stored in a seperated script folder. Its not required to use them but they may help you with your afford.

== Assembly ==
To assemble the project and build a distributable form of it run 

mvn package -Pintegration-test,license-check,docs

in the root folder and then change to the folder 'build' and run 

mvn dependency:unpack
mvn assembly:assembly

Now in the target directory of the build folder a zip file is created that contains a distributable form of the project. Furthermore you can use the shell script in the build folder called 'assemble.sh', which automates the steps explained above.
