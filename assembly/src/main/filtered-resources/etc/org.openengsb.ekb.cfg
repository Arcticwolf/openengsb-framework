# This property defines how the concurrency problems in the persist interface are dealt with.
# In principle, there are two features for that, the CONCURRENT_WRITE_PROTECTION and the
# EXPECTED_HEAD_REVISION_CHECK. The first one needs no special explanation, but the second one
# does need it: If it is activated, the additional "parent" parameter of the PersistInterface methods
# is considered. If the current head of a specific context is not the passed "parent" context,
# an EKBConcurrentException is thrown.
# CONCURRENT_WRITE_PROTECTION  ... it is not possible that two threads are writing concurrently in 
#                                  the same context. An EKBConcurrentException is thrown otherwise.
# EXPECTED_HEAD_REVISION_CHECK ... see the explanation above.
# BOTH                         ... both features are activated.
# DEACTIVATED                  ... both features are deactivated.
