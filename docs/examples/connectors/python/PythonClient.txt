To test the OPENENGSB jms implementation with Python download Stomppy from http://code.google.com/p/stomppy/.
It comes with a cli.py script used to send JMS Messages via stomp.

Start the Stomppy client with Host and PORT parameters. Default should be:
python cli.py -H localhost -P 6549.

To subscribe to a specific Queue call "subscribe /queue/<DomainName>_method_send". For example:
"subscribe /queue/ExampleDomain_method_send".

When a request is sent via the above queue you can answer via sending a message to the return queue:
"send /queue/ExampleDomain_method_return {"type":"Return","message":"abcde"}". Please consult the JMS Connector documentation
for information about the message format.

The return message will then be mapped to the return value of the request method and ultimately shown in the UI.
