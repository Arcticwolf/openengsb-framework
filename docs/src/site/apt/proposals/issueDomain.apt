Issue Tracker Domain

  This page provides object and interface descriptions needed for the integration of issue tracking systems into OpenEngSB.
  The mapping between the interface of the specific issue tracker and OpenEngSB is designed to
  be easily extensible (e.g. adding new fields from issue trackers). There are a lot of issue trackers on the market.
  The focus lies on open source issue trackers. To model the interface 4 widespread systems were chosen:
  
  * Mantis
  
  * GitHub
  
  * Bugzilla
  
  * Trac


* Comparison

**Issue Object

  We decided to use the least common delimiter to keep the issue object as small as possible while still containing all the basic features.
  
  Used Fields:
  
  * id
  
  * summary
  
  * description
  
  * owner
  
  * reporter
  
  * priority (immediate, urgent, high, normal, low, none)
  
  * status (new, assigned, closed)
  
  []

  We are using constants for priority and status instead of enums because they can't be accessed in Drools which will most likely get fixed with version 5.1
  
  Comments are added to the issue via the addComment function of the domain.
  
**Issue Domain

  The domain currently implements four basic methods (see interface description):
  
  * createIssue
  
  * addComment
  
  * updateIssue
  
  * deleteIssue
  
  []

**Projects

  The project will be handled by the connectors. Basically there will be one endpoint per project per connector.
  The connector needs to add the issue to the right project.
  See tracConnector for Examples
