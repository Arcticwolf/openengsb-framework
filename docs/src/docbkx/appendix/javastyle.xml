<title>Java Coding Style</title>
<section>
    <title>Sun Coding Guidelines</title>
    <para>
      The OpenEngSB Coding Guidelines are based upon the
      <ulink url="http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConvTOC.doc.html">Code
      Conventions for the Java Programming Language</ulink>.  There are some additions and
      deviations for this project.
    </para>
    <section>
  <title>Line lenght</title>
  <para>
    A line length of 80 was standard 10 years ago, but with increasing screen
    size and resolution a length of 120 is more reasonable.
  </para>
    </section>
    <section>
  <title>Wrapping</title>
  <para>
  Use the auto-formatter of your IDE. Import the
  <ulink url="http://dev.openengsb.org/resources/eclipse/formatter.xml">Eclipse Formatter file</ulink>.
  </para>
    </section>
    <section>
  <title>Nubmer of declarations per line</title>
  <para>
    Only one declaration per line is allowed.
  </para>
    </section>
    <section>
  <title>Declaration placement</title>
  <para>
    Declare variables where they are needed. It's easier to read and restricts the
    scope of variables.  Don't overshadow variables.
  </para>
    </section>
    <section>
  <title>Blank lines</title>
  <para>
    The body of a method should not start with a blank line.
  </para>
    </section>
</section>
<section>
    <title>General</title>
    <section>
  <title>File format</title>
  <para>
    Every Java file has to be UTF-8 encoded and has to use UNIX line endings.
    Indentations consist of four spaces, tab-stops are not allowed.
  </para>
    </section>
    <section>
  <title>Header</title>
  <para>
    Every source file has to start with this header:

*/
</programlisting>
  </para>
    </section>
    <section>
  <title>Duplication</title>
  <para>
    Code duplication has to be avoided at all costs.
  </para>
    </section>
    <section>
    <title>Use guards</title>
    <para>
      Guards are a possibility to reduce the amount of nesting.  Heavily nested
code is much harder to read.

Bad:
<programlisting>  public void foo() {
if (conditionA) {
  if (conditionB) {
      if (conditionC) {
    // do some work
      }
  } else {
      throw new MyException();
  }
}
}</programlisting>

Good:
<programlisting>  public void foo() {
if (!conditionA) {
return;
}

if (!conditionB) {
throw new MyException();
}

if (!conditionC) {
return;
}

// do some work
}</programlisting>

    </para>
    </section>
    <section>
  <title>Keep methods short</title>
  <para>
    Methods longer than 40 lines are candidates for refactoring. A method should only
    do one thing and has to be easily understandable. The number of arguments should be
    minimized.  A method should only be at a single level of abstraction.
  </para>
    </section>
    <section>
  <title>Use enums</title>
  <para>
    Prefer typesafe enumerations over integer constants.
  </para>
    </section>
    <section>
  <title>Avoid use of static members</title>
  <para>  Static members are a sign of a design error because they are like global variables.
  It's fine if you declare a constant as final abstract of course.
  </para>
    </section>
    <section>
  <title>Use fully qualified imports</title>
  <para>
    Don't import org.example.package.*, instead import the needed classes.
  </para>
    </section>
    <section>
  <title>Never declare implementation types</title>
  <para>
    Use interfaces or the abstract base class instead of concrete implementation
    classes where possible.

    Don't write:
    <programlisting><![CDATA[ArrayList<String> names = new ArrayList<String>();]]></programlisting>

Instead use the interface name:
<programlisting><![CDATA[List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>();]]></programlisting>

    This is especially important in method signatures.
  </para>
    </section>
    <section>
  <title>SerialVersionUID</title>
  <para>
    Don't declare serialVersionUID just because your IDE tells you. Have a good reason
    why you need it.  This can cause bugs that are hard to detect.
  </para>
    </section>
    <section>
  <title>Restrict scope of suppressed warnings</title>
  <para>
   If you have to suppress a warning make sure you give it the smallest possible scope.
   This means you should never annotate a whole class with @SuppressWarnings. A method may
   be acceptable but you should try to annotate the problematic statements instead.
  </para>
    </section>
    <section>
  <title>Use String.format()</title>
  <para>
    Use String.format() instead of long concatenation chains which are hard to read.
  </para>
    </section>
    <section>
  <title>Array declaration style</title>
  <para>
    Always use
    <programlisting> Type[] arrayName;</programlisting>

    instead of the C-like
    <programlisting>Type arrayName[];</programlisting>
  </para>
    </section>
    <section>
  <title>Comments</title>
  <para>
    Don't make funny comments, be professional. All comments have to be in English.
    Comment what methods do, not how they do it. Do not comment what is already stated
    in code.
  </para>
    </section>
</section>
<section>
    <title>Naming</title>
    <section>
  <title>Interfaces</title>
  <para>
    Interfaces are not marked by starting their names with I.  This exposes
    more information than necessary and is not Java-like.
  </para>
    </section>
    <section>
  <title>Don't abbreviate</title>
  <para>
    Do not use abbreviations if it's not a project wide standard. Long method names
    are preferable to inconsistency.  With automatic code completion this isn't a problem
    anyway.
  </para>
    </section>
</section>
<section>
    <title>No clutter</title>
    <para>
      <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>Exception/Log Messages have to be concise. Don't end messages with "...".</listitem>

  <listitem>Don't overuse FINAL, use it where you have a good reason something has to be
    final.  Although it doesn't hurt to declare everything as final it clutters the
    code.
  </listitem>
  
  <listitem>Don't use history tables in source files.  Use the SCM system if you are
    interested in the changes of a file.
  </listitem>
  
  <listitem>Don't use the JavaDoc author tag.  Also use the SCM system.</listitem>

  <listitem>Don't declare unnecessary constructors, especially the empty default constructor.</listitem>
  
  <listitem>Don't make implicit calls explicitly, i.e. calling super(); in every constructor.</listitem>
  
  <listitem>Don't specify modifiers that are implicit, i.e. don't make methods in interfaces
    <code>public abstract</code>.</listitem>
    
  <listitem>Don't initialize fields with null, they are automatically initialized with null.</listitem>
  
  <listitem>Don't use banners in comments.</listitem>
  
  <listitem>Don't use closing brace comments, i.e. } // end if, they are a sign of too long
    methods.</listitem>
    
  <listitem>Don't comment out code and commit it. This confuses programmers why it is there.
   Simply delete it, it's still present in the SCM history.
  </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
</section>
<section>
    <title>Exception Handling</title>
    <para>
      <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>Don't log and throw. Either a exception should be logged or thrown to be processed
    at a more appropriate place.
  </listitem>
    
  <listitem>Don't swallow exceptions silently. If you have to do it, you have to make a comment
    stating the reason.
  </listitem>
  
  <listitem>Use runtime exceptions where possible.</listitem>

  <listitem>Wrap exceptions in a RuntimeException if you don't want to specify the Exception in
   your method signature and you can't handle it.
  </listitem>
  
  <listitem>
    Write meaningful exception message.
  </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
</section>
<section>
    <title>Tests</title>
    <section>
  <title>General</title>
  <para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>Make use of JUnit 4 features, e.g. @Test(expected = SomeException.class)</listitem>
      
      <listitem>Tests should not output anything. They have to be automatically verified.</listitem>
      
      <listitem>Don't catch exceptions just to fail manually. Declare the method to throw the exception.</listitem>
      
      <listitem>Install a shutdown hook for test data files. This assures that they will be deleted and the
      project remains in a clean state.
      </listitem>
     
     <listitem>Use <ulink url="http://code.google.com/p/mockito/">Mockito</ulink> for mocking.</listitem>
     
     <listitem>
      Tests should have descriptive method names. It should be deducible what will be tested.
      Bad: <code>testError()</code>. 
      Good: <code>invalidInMessageShouldReturnErrorResponse()</code>.
     </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
  </para>
    </section>
    <section>
  <title>Naming Scheme</title>
  <para>
    The Maven profiles for running the tests are configured to filter based on the
    naming of the test class. The package layout is just a further convenience for the
    developer for running the tests manually.

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>Unit Tests test one class/method/feature in isolation from their dependencies by
      using test doubles as replacement. They should be fast and need no special environment
      setup for execution.
    </listitem>
    
    <listitem>Filenames end with Test.java</listitem>

    <listitem>Located in the normal package structure,
      i.e. \outer.project.package\.\inner.project.package\
    </listitem>
    
    <listitem>Integration Tests combine individual software modules to test their interaction with
      each other. They do not need a special environment setup for execution.
    </listitem>

    <listitem>Filenames end with IT.java</listitem>
    <listitem>Located in \outer.project.package\.it.\inner.project.package\</listitem>

    <listitem>User Tests need a special execution environment and thus are not run
   automatically during any maven phase.
    </listitem>
    
    <listitem>Filenames end with UT.java</listitem>
    <listitem>Located in \outer.project.package\.ut.\inner.project.package\</listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  </para>
    </section>
</section>
<section>
    <title>XML Formatting</title>
    <section>
  <title>File Format</title>
  <para>
    Every XML file has to be UTF-8 encoded and has to use UNIX line endings.
    Indentations consist of TWO spaces, tabstops are not allowed. The line length
    shouldn't exceed 120 characters.
  </para>
    </section>
    <section>
  <title>Indent DTD properly</title>
  <para>
    There should be a new line for every namespace:
<programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[
