      To create a distributable form of the OpenEngSB simply issue the following commands in the root directory of the project.
      <programlisting>
        > mvn package -Pall-test,license-check,docs
        > cd build
        > mvn assembly:assembly
      </programlisting> 
      Then a zip file is created in the folder build/target. The structure of the zip is explained in the following section.
      To ease this process a shell script is contained in the build directory (assemble.sh).
