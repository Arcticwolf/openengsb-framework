  <para>
  	A http-request may look like this: http://openengsb.you.com:8192/Link/?UUID:83467585-0475975-2348565-82936498
  </para>
  <para>
		When such a request is sent to the server (e.g. with any webbrowser) a process on the server is triggered:
		<orderedlist>
	  	<listitem>Analyze the request</listitem>
	  	<listitem>Retrieve the tool-link with the given UUID from the link-service (edb)</listitem>
			<listitem>Send the result back to the IP that requested the Link via JMS.</listitem>
		</orderedlist>
	</para>
  <para>
		A local client-application must be present and running on the requestors machine to automatically open the program.
		A sample implementation of the client is available in
		features/link/http-processor/service-engine/src/test/java/org/openengsb/link/http/JmsListener.java
	</para>
  <section id="link.http.client">
	  <title>Client Application</title>
  	<para>The client sends a "whoami"-HTTP-request to the server like this: http://openengsb.you.com:8192/Link/?whoami
  		The server response to the request is a HTML-page showing the remote IP-address of the client. This IP is used
  		by the server for sending responses via JMS. Then the client starts a JMS-message consumer listening to the
  		topic "org.openengsb.link.http". A message-filter must be set so that the client only receives responses
  		concerning it.
