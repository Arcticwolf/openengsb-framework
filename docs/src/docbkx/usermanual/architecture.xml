    Since this manual is the user manual only a very basic overview over the architecture should be given. For more
    detailed overview use the own architectural manual also provided at openengsb.org.

          Actually there are two different kinds of connectors - internal and external ones. 
          <link linkend="internalConnectors">Internal connectors</link> are directly implemented into the OpenEngSB
          and could be used to access external tools or be able to embed tools completely into the OpenEngSB. Differently
          <link linkend="externalConnectors">external connectors</link> are written outside of the OpenEngSB. This requires
          them to be available from the bus and to communicate with the bus. Both ways of communication have to be established
          via an external protocol, since the internal communication module could not be used. Since most connectors
          not directly produced by the OpenEngSB team or contributors will be 
          <link linkend="externalConnectors">external connectors</link> we will start with them.

      Although engineering systems could be a very complex system
      nevertheless all engineering teams are using the same
      tools throughout all their work. Nevertheless how complex such an
      infrastructure is you'll always find an
      <literal moreinfo="none">Issue Tracker</literal>, a
      <literal moreinfo="none">SCM</literal>
      and so on. Therefore it is possible to define base messages and base
      systems for all of them. At the moment the following types are
      designed and avaialble (or in a short period of time).
