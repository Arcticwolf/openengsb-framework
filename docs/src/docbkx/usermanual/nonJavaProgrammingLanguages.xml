  <title>Other ways to connect to the OpenEngSB</title>
  <para>
    The OpenEngSB internal is completely written in the Java programming language. Nevertheless it could be accessed
    by other programming languages with the help of JMS. Apache ActiveMQ does provide interfaces for many different 
    programming languages as CSharp, Ruby, Perl, Python, PHP, C++. This section describes how to connect to the 
    OpenEngSB from these languages.

      <title>Connect with CSharp</title>
      <para>
        The CSharp connector is written on basis of the Apache ActiveMQ NMS connector and with help of the Spring 
        NmsTemplate. The code is checked into the repository and could be found in openengsb/openengsb-nonjava/csharp. 
        There an EngSB.sln file. This project file had been developed with SharpDevelop3, but is also tested with 
        VisualStudio2008 CSharp Express Edition with the .net framework 3.5.
