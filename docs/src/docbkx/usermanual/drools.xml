  <title>Drools</title>

  <para>
  	The openengsb-drools component takes "events" as input and handles them
  	using a rulebased system (JBoss Drools 5.0). The rules are managed
  	independent of servicemix in the Drools Guvnor. Guvnor is a webapplication
  	running inside a JBoss Application Server. The rulebase can be managed with
  	the webinterface. For specifying conditions in rules a model is needed. A
  	model is described in simple Java objects. The default model is located in
  	the "workflow/drools/domains"-project. The following example shows how a rule
  	can be specified.
  </para>
  <orderedlist>
  	<listitem>
  		Login guvnor
			<para>
				Take the browser to the guvnor webinterface (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8080/drools-guvnor) and login with your
				credentials. 
			</para>
  	</listitem>
  	<listitem>
  		Setup package
			<para>
				select "Knowledge Bases" in the sidebar and Create a new package named "org.openengsb".
			</para>
  	</listitem>
  	<listitem>
			Build and upload the model
			<para>
				Open a command-shell in the "workflow/drools/domains"-directory and execute "mvn install". This compiles the
				model and packs it to target/openengsb-workflow-drools-domains-VERSION.jar. Use the webinterface to upload the model by
				selecting "Create New->Upload POJO Model jar". Enter a name (e.g. "mymodel") and confirm the dialog. Now
				browse to the openengsb-workflow-drools-domains-VERSION.jar and upload it. When that is done click "save changes" in the
				top-left corner of the frame. Enter a commit-message (e.g. "add openengsb-workflow-drools-domains-VERSION").
			</para>
  	</listitem>
  	<listitem>
  		Create a new rule with the webinterface
  		<para>
  			Select "Create New->New Rule" and enter a name for the new rule. Assign it to a category (does not influence
  			functionality of the rule). Then choose which type of rule you would like to create. The easiest to use type
  			is the "Business Rule (guided editor)". In the WHEN-area you may specify conditions (e.g. using the
  			Event-model). In the THEN-area you may specify the actions. In actions you can modify the knowledge
  			(e.g. the current event) or trigger actions in openengsb. To trigger actions select "call method on helper...".
				You can use information contained in the event by binding it to a variable. Click on the field in the
				when-condition and providing a variable name.
  		</para>
  	</listitem>
  	<listitem>
  		Compile the rulebase
  		<para>
  			For the changes to be applied for usage in the workflow the rules must be compiled. You only need to select the
  			package (org.openengsb) in the sidepane and then click "Build package" in the right frame.
