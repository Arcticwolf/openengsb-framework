    <para>
      To set up the email connector set the following values in the context store.
    </para>
    
    <programlisting><![CDATA[<projectId>/notification/email/config/<javax mail property>
<projectId>/notification/email/user
<projectId>/notification/email/password]]></programlisting>

    <para>
      Where projectId is the id of the current project. In the config "directory" of the context you can put all 
      the javax mail properties and their values that you want to configure. A minimum configuration would typically include:
      
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          mail.smtp.user - Should be the same as user in most cases. Is currently also used as sender address.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          mail.smtp.host - The smtp host used for sending.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          mail.smtp.auth - Boolean to indicate if authentication shall be used.
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      
      For more details see the javax.mail documentation.
