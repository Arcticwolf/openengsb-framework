  <title id="domainProposals.title">Proposals</title>

<para>
  A main directive of OpenEngSB is its continuous extension. Most ideas are discussed
 in the mailinglist first, but at some point a more consistent way of specification is required.
 For the OpenEngSB project this should be done via written proposals in the proposals
 section. This article explains in more details what this means and how it should be handled.

<section>
  <title>General</title>

  <para>
    First of all some general information about proposals; Please write them, as everything else
    on this document in English! Further write all proposals in APT and add them to the 
    <filename>/docs/src/docbkx/domain/proposals</filename> directory. The structure itself
    could be chosen by the type of the document.

<section>
  <title>Domain Description</title>

  <para>
    This section describes what should be contained in the proposal for an interface description.
    The structure of the documents themselves should be done in the following form:
  </para>
 
  <orderedlist>
    <listitem>Which tools exist for the domain</listitem>
 
    <listitem>What does these tools can, what is the common sense between these tools</listitem>
 
    <listitem>What services are required for the domain to use the services available. This should be done in
      "the java way of live". Simply define an interface and document it and its data types in most
      detail.</listitem>
    
    <listitem>Define which events could be thrown by the domain. Define java classes and describe in detail
      when this event should be thrown.</listitem>
    
 </orderedlist> 
</section>
</chapter>
