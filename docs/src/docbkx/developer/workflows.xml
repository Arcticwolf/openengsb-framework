  <title>Workflows</title>

  <para>The OpenEngSB supports the modeling of workflows. This could be done by two different approaches. First of all a
    rule-based event approach, by defining actions based on events (and their content) whiche where thrown in or to the
    bus. Events are practical for "short-time handling" since they are also easy to replace and extend. For long running
    business processes the secondary workflow method could be used which is <link linkend="workflows.processes">based on
    processes described in Drools-Flow</link>.</para>

  <para>The workflow service takes "events" as input and handles them using a rulebased system (JBoss Drools). It
    provides methods to manage the rules. TBW</para>
