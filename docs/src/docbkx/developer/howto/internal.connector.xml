  <title>How To Create an Internal Connector</title>

  <para>This chapter describes how to implement a tool connector for the OpenEngSB environment. A tool connector is an
    adapter between an external tool and the OpenEngSB. Every connector belongs to a domain which defines the common
    interface of all its connectors. This means that the connector is responsible to translate all calls to the common
    interface to the externally provided tool.</para>

    <para>In case it isn't known what a tool domain is and how it defines the interface for the tool connector then
        <link linkend="developer.architectur.domain"/> is a good starting point. If there's already a matching domain
      for this tool it is strongly recommended to use it. But if this tool requires a new domain it has to be created.
      This is also described in <link linkend="developer.howto.internal.domain"/>
