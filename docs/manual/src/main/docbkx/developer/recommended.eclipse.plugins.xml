    <title>Eclipse CS</title>
    <para>The <link xlink:href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/checkstyle-plug">checkstyle plugin</link> 
    integrates checkstyle into Eclipse. Conformance with checkstyle criteria has to be checked before each push to 
    the repository, so integrating the check into the IDE helps developers to already conform to the checkstyle 
    criteria during development. You have to configure the plug-in to use our checkstyle configuration file, which
    can be found
