  <title>Wiring</title>

  <para>The interface for administrators to do wiring, which is a key concept of the OpenEngSb.
    Wiring is a process, where global variables get connected with connectors (domain endpoints) 
    in a certain context. As there are several steps to do that, this page gives you a fast  
    and easy managing possibility. For further reading, please visit  
    <link xlink:href="http://www.openengsb.org/nightly/docbook/developer.context.html"></link>.

  <section>
    <title>Wire a global variable with a service</title>
    <para>The first thing you must do, is to select a domain in the drop-down-field. Doing that, 
      all domain endpoints and all globals of this type will be loaded. If nothing appears, then there 
      will be probably no suitable item available. 
    </para>
    <para>
      Second, you must chose a global. There are two possibilities to do that. Either you select one 
      from the list or you write autonomous a name of a global in the corresponding text field.
      If the global doesn't exist, there will be a new one created with the type of the selected domain.
      If a global already exists and have another type as selected, then there will be an error message
      after submitting.  
    </para>
    <para>
      Third, you must select a domain endpoint from the corresponding list. The list will be loaded
      after you have selected a domain.
    </para>
    <para>
      Fourth, you must select the contexts, where the wiring shall happen. 
      You can select all but at least one. 
    </para>
    <para>
      After submitting the form, a success message for each context should appear.
      If an error occurs, an error message will be shown.
    </para>

  <section>
    <title>What wiring does in the background</title>
    <para>The properties of the service will be updated. First, it will try to get the property with the key 
      'location.' + context from these properties, because there are all locations stored. If there is no such 
      attribute, a new property will be added. After that it will insert a new location, which is the 
      name of the given global. As there can be more locations, the new one will be appended excepted such 
      location already exists. Then nothing will be done.
