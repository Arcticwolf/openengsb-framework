  <title>Deployer services</title>

  <para>The OpenEngSB supports file-based configuration through its deployer services. These services are constantly checking the "config/" directory for new/changed/deleted configuration files.</para>
  <para>If a new file is created, its configuration is loaded into the OpenEngSB. When the file changes the configuration is updated and when it is deleted the configuration is unloaded. Each deployer handles a different type of configuration file represented by different file name extensions. Details and structure of these files are covered in this section.
  </para>
  <para>It should be noted that the OpenEngSB itself uses deployer services for internal configuration. For this purpose the deployer services also listen for configuration files in "etc/". These config files however are essential for the correct operation of the OpenEngSB and should not be modified.

    <title>Connector configuration</title>
    <para>The connector deployer service creates, updates or deletes instances of connector services.</para>
    <para> All files in the "config/" directory with the extension ".connector" are handled by the connector deployer. The .connector files have to be simple property files containing the configuration properies of a certain connector service and their values. Additionaly the property with the key "connector" defines which type of connector shouold be created (corresponds to the "connector" property in the service definition) and the property with the key "id" defines the new service id.   
    </para>
    <example><title>Example .connector configuration file for the email connector</title>
	    <programlisting>
connector = email
id = testServiceId
user = user
password = test
prefix = [test]
smtpAuth = true
smtpSender = test@test.com
smtpPort = 25
smtpHost = smtp.testserver.com</programlisting>
