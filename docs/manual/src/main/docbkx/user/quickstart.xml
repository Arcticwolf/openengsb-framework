    <title>Quickstart</title>

    <para>As a developer you have basically two ways in which you can use the OpenEngSB. One option is to use the OpenEngSB as a
      runtime environment for any project. In addition you've the possibility to write Plug-Ins (Domains, Connectors, ...) for 
      the OpenEngSB. Both cases are explained in this chapter.</para>

        <para>Unimplemented domain methods should always throw an exception rather than return default value or do nothing.
            Therefore each domain method without body must throw DomainMethodNotImplementedException to indicate that requested domain functionality is not implemented.
