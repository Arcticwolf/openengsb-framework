  <title>Taskbox</title>

  <para>The Taskbox is a service to be used by help desk applications. It consists of a core and an UI project.
  The core is responsible for storing tickets and tasks (via persistence) and used to throw events and start workflows.
  It also provides methods which can be called by workflows e.g. assigning a task to a different role or setting a status.
  It is also the job of the core taskbox to choose the right wicket panel from the UI project to display the right
  information in a certain situation. So the idea is that an application which wants to use the taskbox only has to
  define an area in a wicket page in which the taskbox is to be bound. The taskbox then takes control and takes user
  interaction and autonomously decides which panel to show.</para>

  <para>For each main action, the Taskbox throws an event. Examples for that are create, assign, finish or edit events.
  These events are used to trigger or resume workflows and they can also be recorded by another component which then can
  reconstruct the flow based on them.</para>
