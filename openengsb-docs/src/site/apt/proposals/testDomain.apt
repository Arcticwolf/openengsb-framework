  [ATTENTION:] This page is only a proposal! This means that everyone is allowed to edit this page and it is

Test Domain

  The Test Domain is also characterized by Ant and Maven. Because both tools include the tests in the build process.
Maven considers a test failure to be a build failure, when the goals package or install are used.

  Another important aspect for the test domain is which Test Framework is used for the test. Especially, the JUnit and the TestNG plays important roles.


{Comparison}
	
  The Comparison of Maven and Ant is already defined in the {Build Domain}.
  
  The Comparison of the Framework 
  
  
*---+---+---*---*
|Options|Meaning|JUnit|TestNG| 
*---+---+---*---*
|outputDirectory|A String indicating the directory where should the XML files be outputed.|+|+|
*---+---+---*---*
|timestampFormat|Specifies the format of date fields that are generated by this reporter.|+|+|
*---+---+---*---*
|fileFragmentationLevel|An integer having the values 1, 2 or 3, indicating the way that the XML files are generated, 1 - will generate all the results in one file, 2 - each suite is generated in a separate XML file that is linked to the main file, 3 - same as 2 plus separate files for test-cases that are referenced from the suite files.|-|+|
*---+---+---*---*
|splitClassAndPackageNames|This boolean specifies the way that class names are generated for the \<class\> element. For example, you will get \<class class="com.test.MyTest"\> for false and \<class class="MyTest" package="com.test"\> for true.|-|+|
*---+---+---*---*
|generateGroupsAttribute|A boolean indicating if a groups attribute should be generated for the \<test-method\> element. This feature aims at providing a straight-forward method of retrieving the groups that include a test method without having to surf through the \<group\> elements.|-|+| 
*---+---+---*---*
|stackTraceOutputMethod|Specifies the type of stack trace that is to be generated for exceptions and has the following values, 0 - no stacktrace (just Exception class and message), 1 - a short version of the stack trace keeping just a few lines from the top, 2 - the complete stacktrace with all the inner exceptions, 3 - both short and long stacktrace|-|+|
*---+---+---*---*
|generateDependsOnMethods|Use this attribute to enable/disable the generation of a depends-on-methods attribute for the \<test-method\> element. |-|+|
*---+---+---*---*
|generateDependsOnGroups|Enable/disable the generation of a depends-on-groups attribute for the \<test-method\> element. |-|+|
*---+---+---*---*
|forkmode|JVM should be forked for each test.|+|-|
*---+---+---*---*
  
  A big advantage is that Ant use JUnit as one of the tasks to set options, that could be used all the time.
For example, there could be set:
  
  * JVM

  * Timeout in milliseconds
  
  * the output can be handled with a formatter or to decide if it is shown or not
  
  * the max. Memory for the forked JVM
  
  []
  
  At the end of the test, a result object should be used to manage the different objects from the tools.
