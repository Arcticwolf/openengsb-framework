  <title>How to communicate with the Engineering Data Base</title>
  
  <section>
    <title id="general">General</title>

    <para>To communicate with the EDB instances in the OpenEngSB, it is required to send JMS messages to the queue "org.openengsb.edb", while the message type defines the actual operation. Schemas and/or samples of the messages can be found in the following sections.</para>

  </section>
  
  <section>
    <title id="contentStorage">Content Storage</title>

    <para>The EDB endpoint can receive messages to store and query content (as well as undoing the last changes). (TODO: add operation element) The schema for a storing content goes as follows:</para>    

    <programlisting>
      <![CDATA[persist]]>
    </programlisting>
    <para>NOTE: the field "path" defines the abstract path names of the hierachical structure of the content, where the fieldnames with the elements from "path" describe the actual path, i.e. path = "/a/b/c" is abstract and the actual path is a="any", b="real", c="pathName".</para> 
    <para>Queries are structured as [keyname]:[valuename](AND [keyname]:[valuename])*, whereas [keyname] can be every possible fieldname of the stored content. The entire schema goes as follows</para>

    <programlisting>
      <![CDATA[query]]>
    </programlisting>
    <para>TODO: describe reset message</para>
    <programlisting>
      <![CDATA[TODO:reset schema]]>
    </programlisting>

  </section>

  <section>
    <title id="linking">Linking</title>

    <para>The messages described in this section are used to register and query for links.</para>
    <para>The RegisterLinkMessage is used to create a new link which consists of a "source" element (usually the uuid of another element stored in the EDB should be used here), a "type" referencing any tool this link should be applied too and a "param", encapsulating the command that should be send to the targetted application,</para>
    <programlisting>
      <![CDATA[linkregister]]>
    </programlisting>
    
    <para>The LinkQuerMessage is used to retrieve all links matching the a given search criterion. The usual criterion should be the "source" field, although it is possible to search for type and/or param as well.</para>
