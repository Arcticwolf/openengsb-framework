    <title id="contentStorage">Content Storage</title>

    <para>The EDB endpoint can receive messages to store and query content (as well as undoing the last changes). The schema for a storing content goes as follows:</para>    

    <programlisting>
      <![CDATA[persist]]>
    </programlisting>
    <para>NOTE: the field "path" defines the abstract path names of the hierachical structure of the content, where the fieldnames with the elements from "path" describe the actual path, i.e. path = "/a/b/c" is abstract and the actual path is a="any", b="real", c="pathName".</para> 
    <para>Queries are structured as [keyname]:[valuename](AND [keyname]:[valuename])*, whereas [keyname] can be every possible fieldname of the stored content. The entire schema goes as follows</para>
