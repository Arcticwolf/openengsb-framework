			</listitem>
			<listitem>

			</listitem>
			<listitem>

			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
  </para>
  <para>
  	When the SE recieves a message, it parses the message into a java-object (Event). Then a rulebase-session is opened
  	where the event is inserted. The rules specify their actions in java-code by calling methods on a helper-class, that
  	is referenced as "helper" inside the rules. The rules for the rulebase are maintained in a guvnor-server which
  	provides a webinterface. One may also use the eclipse-drools-plugin to interface with the server.
