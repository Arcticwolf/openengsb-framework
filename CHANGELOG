openengsb-2.1.0 2011-10-21 
--------------------------------------------

The second release of the 2.x series of the OpenEngSB Framework fixed 61 issues. Among the various bugs we where able to
make jaxws work out of the box in the OpenEngSB framework, removing jre 1.5 pseudo compability and finally deploy the
sources to m2 central. The OpenEngSBCoreService#getConfigPersistence and EngineeringKnowledgeBase had been deprecated
opening the doors for better, new implementations of them. There had been various minor improvements to the UI; But the
most important improvement was definitely that all scripts could now be setup via setenv/setenv.bat which does not longer
forces child projects to write all scripts for themselves. In addition this makes start, stop, ... scripts work as 
expected. Another important change was that we've splitted the background persistence bundle into three main bundles 
which could be configured and replaced now as required. To complete the new feature set of the 2.1.0 release of the
OpenEngSB Framework we've included an upgrade for Apache Karaf (2.2.4), Apache CXF (2.4.3), Apache Wicket (1.4.19), 
Pax Wicket (0.7.5), OpenEngSB Root (24) and the PaxExam Karaf Testframework (0.3.0).

openengsb-1.3.0.M3 2011-07-15 
--------------------------------------------

The third milestone release of the OpenEngSB fixes 86 issues. The most important enhancement is the introduction
of pax-wicket into the OpenEngSB. This is the base for splitting up the UI and help to reuse and extend it into
user applications as required. A first prototype of the Enterprise Database 2.0 shows the way we want to go in
versioning tool data. A new pipline architecture allows secured remote calls and the console prototype shows where
we want to go in future 1.3 milestone releases. The newly added configuration backends help to configure the 
OpenEngSB using files. Finally bugs, identified in former 1.3.0.Mx releases, are fixed. Also worth mentioning: 
The speed and stability of the OpenEngSB had been increased.

### Highlights
  * Pax Wicket based UI
  * EDB 2.0 Protoype included
  * Stabilized remoting
  * Switched back to Apache Felix as OSGi engine.
  * Various documentaiton enhancements
  * Configuration persistence backend with various implementations

openengsb-1.3.0.M2 2011-05-20 
--------------------------------------------

The second milestone release of the OpenEngSB fixes 43 issues. The most important enhancements are the possibility
to wire connectors via the admin UI and the rewrite of the ports-infrastructure. This allows an easy introduction
of security and more complex operations in future 1.3 milestone releases. Besides, new example connectors had been
added. The OpenEngSB uses the latest versions of Apache Karaf (2.2.1), Aries Blueprint (0.3.1) and OpenEngSB Root (17)
again. In addition the remote infrastructure had been extended and received further stabilization. Finally bugs,
identified in former 1.3.x releases, are fixed. Also worth mentioning: The speed and stability of the OpenEngSB had 
been increased.

### Highlights
  * Karaf shows information to each bundle now using "osgi:info ID" in the console
  * New administration page to wire connectors via the UI
  * Ports remote structure is now based on filter/pipelining
  * Completely rewritten C# examples
  * Using the latest Apache Karaf version (2.2.1)
  * Finally fixing JMS restart/integration test problems
  * Based on openengsb-framework 1.3.0.M2 connectors/domains could finally run accross various versions
  * Ports-JMS does no longer require an external JMS Server
  * Wicket is no longer required in the openengsb-core feature
  * Using higher default memory/perm-space increases startup speed and stability.
